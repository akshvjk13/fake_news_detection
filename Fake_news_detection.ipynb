According to the Clinical Trials website, run by the National Institutes of Health, participants must be at least 14 years old and 18-24 weeks pregnant.The controversial study, led by Bliss Kaneshiro, MD and Kate Whitehouse, DO, will monitor bleeding during D&E abortions to determine the effects of the drug oxytocin, commonly used to minimize blood loss and decrease the risk of hemorrhage.The clinical trial, called  Effects of Oxytocin on Bleeding Outcomes during Dilation and Evacuation  began in October 2014 and is a collaboration between UH, Society of Family Planning and the University of Washington.The Society of Family Planning funds a number of similar research projects, such as experimenting with the dosage of Misoprostol, a uterine contracting agent, prior to surgical abortions at 13-18 weeks and exploring umbilical cord injections to produce fetal death prior to late-term abortions.In the UH study, researchers will carry out a  randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials,  to determine the effect of oxytocin s use on uterine bleeding, meaning that they will either provide or deny intravenous oxytocin to the women.Reports suggest that some doctors are concerned that withholding oxytocin during surgery may put patients, especially teen girls, at risk. This study is reminiscent of Nazi concentration camp experiments. I pity the poor women who are being treated like lab rats, especially those who are denied the drug to reduce hemorrhaging,  said Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue.Dilation and evacuation abortions are surgical procedures that involve dismembering the pre-born baby with forceps, scraping the inside of the uterus with a curette to remove any residuals and finally suctioning out the womb to make sure the contents are completely removed.After the abortion, the corpse of the fetus is reassembled and examined to ensure everything was successfully removed and that the abortion was complete.The study is hoping to attract up to 166 test subjects and is expected to conclude in July 2015.Via: Breitbart News\",\n          \"CNN was quick to scoop up Corey Lewandowski after Donald Trump kicked him out of his role as campaign manager, but his first week on the job is going pretty much exactly how you would expect it to go   terribly.Not only has Lewandowski proven himself to be pretty much like a paid spokesman for Trump, but his defense of the disgraced GOP candidate isn t being received well. Earlier this week, Lewandowski revealed that he was under contract and couldn t criticize The Donald, even after being fired from the campaign. Today, Lewandowski got called out by Hillary Clinton surrogate Christine Quinn for hyping Trump up to be an expert on the Brexit decision   a suggestion that was clearly false.On Monday s edition of CNN s New Day, Lewandowski made another pathetic defense of Trump by trying to reframe the candidate s disgusting reaction to Brexit, where he mostly spoke about how much the decision would be good for his Scotland golf resort. Lewandowski s defense was: Obviously the U.S. dollar has become much stronger now against the British pound. If you re going to spend money in Europe, now would actually be a good time to go with the fall of the pound.What you have is a world view, so what you have is someone who is saying,  Let s look at this from the U.S. perspective. If you want to go and travel overseas   just from a monetary perspective   now is the right time to do that because what you re getting is more for your dollar. Quinn wasn t having it. She ripped into Lewandowski, firing back, Donald Trump is not running to be travel agent of the world, he s running to be president of the United States.  She continued: What he said wasn t a commentary on international markets, it was,  When the pound goes down, more people will come to my golf course. Donald Trump s main concern isn t the international markets, it isn t the impact that Brexit will have on hard working Americans  401Ks, it s himself. How can he make more money, how can he put more money in his bank account? Lewandowski compared the Brexit decision to Trump s rise in the GOP, and Quinn once again called him out and put him back in his place. She said: Trump touted that he saw this coming. That s ridiculous because when he was first asked about Brexit by the press, he didn t appear to know what it was. Lewandowski tried to counter by insisting that People are too smart, they are tired of being told what to do.  He then tried to commend Trump for being a selfish moron: You know what Donald Trump said about Brexit? What he said was, you don t have to listen to me because it s not my decision. He didn t weigh in like Hillary Clinton did, like Barack Obama did, saying that you can t do this. Quinn fought back, Because he didn t know what it was. Lewandowski was fighting a losing battle. Trump s reaction to Brexit was just as terrifying as it was humorous   it truly proved that Trump knows nothing about foreign affairs, and hasn t spent any time educating himself since the beginning of his presidential candidacy. If only some of the hours he spent getting into fights on Twitter were being used for learning about how the world works. But instead, he once again exposed himself as an unfit choice for President. And when people like Lewandowski try to make sense of his idiocy, they only make themselves look equally foolish.You can watch the embarrassing video below:Featured image via screen capture\",\n          \"A Michigan woman decided to defend against tyranny? when she and another shopper couldn t agree over who got to buy the last notebook on the shelf at the Novi Towne Center store.According to ABC 13, the brawl   yes, brawl    involved two Farmington Hills residents, ages 46 and 32, and a mother and daughter from South Lyon, ages 51 and 20. In other words, these were all grown adults who should have known better but hey   there was only one notebook on the shelf, and we ve all seen what happens in those post-apocalyptic movies when a store is down to the last gallon of milk, right?Two of the women, one of whom was the unnamed 20-year-old, reached for the notebook at the same time. The 46 and 32-year-olds apparently decided that she wasn t getting their goddamn notebook and began pulling her hair.Then, because this had almost hit peak  trailer park,  the 20-year-old s mother decided to go for bonus points by pulling out her gun. Fortunately, someone pushed her aside before she could do any harm.This is one of the NRA s  responsible gun owners  (conservatives can t dismiss this one, as it is confirmed that she is a concealed carry permit holder)   ready to leap into action at the most minor sign of danger and make things worse by turning the situation potentially deadly.Watch it happen below:Featured image via screengrab\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\",\n          \"politics\",\n          \"Middle-east\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1681,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jun 5, 2015\",\n          \"August 28, 2016\",\n          \"June 3, 2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":5}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_true.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":344},"id":"euk3pXlbwqwc","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1748165130400,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":656,"user":{"displayName":"Akshitha Chunchu","userId":"06024285106304277630"}},"outputId":"9525f444-2688-461a-a278-0fac5ec3229a"},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                               title  ...                date\n","0  As U.S. budget fight looms, Republicans flip t...  ...

The legislation would provide $36.5 billion in emergency relief as Puerto Rico in particular struggles to regain electricity and other basic services following destructive hurricanes. The House of Representatives approved the bill earlier this month. The Trump administration already has indicated it will seek another round of emergency relief from Congress. \",\n          \"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - About a thousand Hungarians protested on Friday against a crackdown on the main opposition party Jobbik which has been  threatened by a record political campaign fine that the party leader describes as a  death sentence  for democracy. Despite the gloomy rhetoric and Jobbik saying it was fighting for survival, support for the demonstration was well down on other similar rallies over the past year. Hungarians will vote for a new parliament in April and Prime Minister Viktor Orban s conservative, anti-migrant Fidesz party is far ahead in the polls, with Jobbik its nearest rival. Jobbik, once on the far right, has turned toward the center in a bid to attract more support and is now campaigning nationwide against Orban, depicting him as the leader of a criminal gang. Orban, rejecting the charges, says his financial standing is  an open book . Last week the state audit office (ASZ) ruled Jobbik had bought political posters far below market prices, breaching rules on political funding, then it slapped a 663 million forint ($2.5 million) penalty on the party. The protesters, waving Jobbik flags and posters deriding the ruling elite, gathered outside the headquarters of Orban s Fidesz party.  What we see unfolding is not an audit office investigation. It is not an official penalty. This is a death sentence with Jobbik s name on it. But in reality, it is a death sentence for Hungarian democracy,  Jobbiik leader Gabor Vona told the crowd. A government spokesman could not comment immediately on his remarks. ASZ chairman Laszlo Domokos is a former Fidesz lawmaker, whom Jobbik and other critics accuse of making decisions in favor of Orban. The audit office denies that. On Friday, ASZ again called on Jobbik to submit information that would challenge its findings, saying it acted fully within its rights throughout the probe. The ruling Fidesz party and the government have denied any involvement in the ASZ probe.  This case has nothing to do with the election campaign,  Orban aide Janos Lazar said on Thursday. For over a year Fidesz has targeted Jobbik, whose move to the center could upend the longstanding status quo of a dominant Fidesz with weaker opponents to its left and its right, said analyst Zoltan Novak at the Centre for Fair Political Analysis. Gyorgy Illes, a 67-year-old pensioner attending the rally, said he used to be a Socialist supporter but got disillusioned as the party struggled to overcome its internal divisions.  This ASZ probe is a clear sign that Orban is way past any remedy. It is a ruthless attack on everything we hold dear. Democracy, the rule of law, equality, you name it,  he said. \",\n          \"BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - China accused the United States on Thursday of interfering in its internal affairs and said it had lodged a complaint after U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law an act laying the groundwork for possible U.S. navy visits to self-ruled Taiwan. Tensions have risen in recent days after a senior Chinese diplomat threatened China would invade Taiwan if any U.S. warships made port visits to the island which China claims as its own territory. On Monday, Chinese jets carried out  island encirclement patrols  around Taiwan, with state media showing pictures of bombers with cruise missiles slung under their wings as they carried out the exercise. On Tuesday, Trump signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2018 fiscal year, which authorizes the possibility of mutual visits by navy vessels between Taiwan and the United States. Such visits would be the first since the United States ended formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 and established ties with Beijing. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said while the Taiwan sections of the law were not legally binding, they seriously violate the  One China  policy and  constitute an interference in China s internal affairs .   China is resolutely opposed to this, and we have already lodged stern representations with the U.S. government,  Lu told a daily news briefing. China is firmly opposed to any official exchanges, military contact, or arms sales between Taiwan and the United States, he added.  Proudly democratic Taiwan has become increasingly concerned with the ramped up Chinese military presence, that has included several rounds of Chinese air force drills around the island in recent months.  Taiwan is confident of its defenses and responded quickly to the Chinese air force drills this week, its government said, denouncing the rise in China s military deployments as irresponsible. Taiwan presidential spokesman Alex Huang, speaking to Taiwan media in comments reported late on Wednesday, said the defense ministry had kept a close watch on the patrols and responded immediately and properly. Taiwan  can ensure there are no concerns at all about national security, and people can rest assured , Huang said. Both sides of the narrow Taiwan Strait, which separates Taiwan from its giant neighbor, have a responsibility to protect peace and stability, he added.  Such a raised military posture that may impact upon and harm regional peace and stability and cross-strait ties does not give a feeling of responsibility, and the international community does not look favorably upon this,  Huang was quoted as saying. Relations have soured considerably since Tsai Ing-wen, who leads Taiwan s independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, won presidential elections last year. China suspects Tsai wants to declare the island s formal independence, a red line for Beijing. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan s security. Taiwan is well equipped with mostly U.S. weapons but has been pressing for more advanced equipment to deal with what it sees as a rising threat from China.

Sawsan Chebli, a 39-year-old state secretary in the Berlin city government, said she was sitting in the front row waiting to speak at a meeting of the Indo-German Society but was not recognized by the head of the group, Hans-Joachim Kiderlen. When he realized his mistake, the retired former German ambassador to India reportedly said:  I wasn t expecting such a young woman. And you are also so beautiful.  Chebli, a member of the centre-left Social Democrats, went ahead with her speech but posted on her Facebook page afterwards that she was in shock.  Of course, I m always experiencing sexism, but I have never experienced anything like what happened today,  she said. Her comments prompted an outpouring in German newspapers and social media, already abuzz as million of women across the world have been sharing their experiences of sexual harassment and abuse in an online campaign using the hashtag #MeToo. Chebli, a former spokeswoman for the German foreign ministry born to Palestinian refugee parents, was swamped with insults on her Facebook page, including suggestions that she wear a Muslim headscarf if she does not want to receive compliments. She also received messages of support, including from women who had similar experiences, including Teresa Buecker, editor-in-chief of the feminist magazine Edition F.  I have also been called up to the stage as the  beautiful speaker  - it is degrading and disrespectful,  Buecker wrote on Twitter. Kiderlen wrote to Chebli to apologize for his  inappropriate address and greeting , the Tagesspiegel daily reported on Thursday. \",\n          \"In addition to be a disgusting criminal and an idiot, Jerome is also a Hillary supporter.

Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump has said Mexico is \\u201ckilling\\u201d U.S. trade, threatening to build a border wall to keep out migrants, block remittances sent home by Mexicans, and raise tariffs against Mexico to protect U.S. jobs. While generally at pains to avoid addressing Trump directly, Mexican government officials have warned that his proposals could do serious damage to both nations\\u2019 economies. Paulo Carreno, Mexico\\u2019s new deputy foreign minister responsible for North America, was appointed in April to lead a drive to bolster his country\\u2019s standing in the United States. Since then, Mexico\\u2019s diplomatic network in the United States has stepped up efforts to reach out to business leaders, as well as politicians and academics, Carreno said, keen to stress that his government took no side in the presidential contest. Of the companies Mexico had met, the majority agreed with a model of bilateral economic cooperation based on free trade that did not involve a border wall, or protective tariffs, he said. \\u201cThey understand the benefit of greater commercial integration, and they live from it in a way,\\u201d said Carreno. \\u201cThey agree that the model we have today is the better one, though of course that\\u2019s not to say it can\\u2019t be improved.\\u201d U.S.-Mexico trade is worth some $500 billion every year and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce says roughly 6 million American jobs depend on it. In addition, an estimated 35 million people in the United States are Mexican or of Mexican background. Mexican business leaders say U.S. companies are crucial allies in their battle to counter Trump\\u2019s arguments. Carreno did not detail which companies Mexico was meeting, though senior officials have said previously that those with major operations south of the border are key interlocutors. They include firms like General Electric as well as carmakers General Motors and Ford. Both carmakers have been attacked by Trump in the campaign for investing in Mexico.   \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politics\",\n          \"Middle-east\",\n          \"News\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2397,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"October 6, 2016\",\n          \"June 10, 2017\",\n          \"Sep 13, 2015\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"class\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":16}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_merge.columns"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"JRs28573zzxy","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1748166046969,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":20,"user":{"displayName":"Akshitha Chunchu","userId":"06024285106304277630"}},"outputId":"5eb62d66-4c13-4346-a7c2-3f6b9d370b14"},"execution_count":19,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["Index(['title', 'text', 'subject', 'date', 'class'], dtype='object')"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":19}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# removing colums which are not required\n","df = df_merge.drop([\"title\", \"subject\",\"date\"], axis = 1)\n","df.isnull().sum()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":146},"id":"82mT-U5Hzz0a","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1748166091640,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":48,"user":{"displayName":"Akshitha Chunchu","userId":"06024285106304277630"}},"outputId":"66cd5a19-23b8-467a-ba20-9be324975039"},"execution_count":20,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["text     0\n","class    0\n","dtype: int64"],"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>text</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>class</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div><br><label><b>dtype:</b> int64</label>"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":20}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#random shuffling the dataframes\n","df = df.sample(frac = 1)\n","df.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"nt3MBJQAzz28","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1748167249744,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1002,"user":{"displayName":"Akshitha Chunchu","userId":"06024285106304277630"}},"outputId":"e5a93cad-e1e9-4869-d56c-d0abd933049e"},"execution_count":21,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                    text  class\n","20433  This is what happens when people are more conc...      0\n","1226   WASHINGTON (Reuters) -

Brawling, fraud, theft, booze and paranoia are quickly turning the situation in Oregon into the fastest failure of a publicly funded reality TV show ever.Blaine Cooper, whose real name is Stanley Blaine Hicks, was accused by another militia member of assaulting him with a sucker punch. The victim of the assault, Jeff Kagan, quickly called upon the government he hates when he dialed 911 after the assault. No reason was given for the assault, other than the fact Kagan walked from his camp across the street, towards the main militia gathering area. When he approached the area, Cooper attacked both Kagan and one other individual. Cooper also attacked one of a 3-member group of people who came to help remove a suicidal veteran who suffered from PTSD. Allegations were made that Cooper planned on using the veteran literally as a target to provoke a violent confrontation with federal authorities, by exploiting his PTSD and suicidal tendencies. While Cooper appears to still be there, he has prevented others from joining to grow their numbers. Count him as about 3 to 4 lost members.Self-titled  Captain  Joe O Shaughnessy stole crowdfunded money from the group s  war chest  to fuel a drinking binge at a local motel. This caused him to be branded a  deserter and a coward  by fellow militia members, such as John Ritzheimer. After all the booze money was gone, the  captain  left the standoff and claimed all statements made about him by the militia members are a smear campaign.Brian  Booda  Cavalier, who goes by the name Fluffy Unicorn (yes he really does) has also been forced out of the militia as well. This happened after he was caught lying about being a former marine when the US Marines confirmed with the press that he has never served a day in his life. Cavalier was the personal bodyguard of Ammon Bundy for a time.The infamous  blue tarp man  LaVoy Finicum, is also leaving the gathering, despite his allegations that the FBI will arrest him if he does. I need to get home. I got cows that are scattered and lost,  Finicum was quoted as saying. Clearly he should have brought his cows with him so he could take care of them.Initial reports that indicated the militia were numbering around 150 individuals appear to have been exaggerated as well. The group was actually 15 people and now it is down to 12 without a federal officer firing a single shot due to bad behavior and directionally challenged cows.Perhaps the first Bundy standoff was more  successful  and avoided mockery because it was relatively new. Who really knows? With luck, these people will make being in a militia as uncool as your dad wearing socks with sandals while chaperoning the school dance.Featured image via WMUR\",\n          \"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Climate scientists worried that President-elect Donald Trump will slash their budgets and sideline their research are entering survival mode, trimming the words \\u201cclimate change\\u201d from study proposals, emphasizing business applications of their work, and safeguarding data that shows global warming is real. The early reactions, gathered by Reuters in more than a dozen interviews, may foretell a broader shift in the U.S. climate science community, which had enjoyed solid political and financial support under President Barack Obama but could be isolated under a new administration skeptical of climate change and committed to expanding oil drilling and coal mining. \\u201cI think it is maybe really necessary to refocus what you are doing and how you are labeling it,\\u201d said Andreas Prein, a scientist at the federally funded National Center for Atmospheric Research, who previously had changed the term \\u201cclimate change\\u201d in a project for the oil industry and expects such linguistic twists to proliferate.  Trump has questioned whether climate change exists and has raised the possibility of withdrawing U.S. support for a global accord to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, which an overwhelming majority of scientists believe is driving sea level rise, droughts and more frequent violent storms.  Trump is also preparing to nominate cabinet members with close oil industry ties, including Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of state and former Texas Governor Rick Perry as energy secretary. A member of the transition team further raised concerns among scientists this month by sending a questionnaire to the Department of Energy seeking the names of researchers there who worked on climate change issues, a move Trump\\u2019s team later disavowed. Federal funding for climate change research, technology and international assistance hit $11.6 billion in 2014, from $2.4 billion in 1993, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office. While Trump has not explicitly said he would cut such funding, one of his advisers told The Guardian newspaper last month that climate research at NASA would be eliminated.  A Trump transition team official did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Prein at National Center for Atmospheric Research said he had replaced the politically charged term \\u201cclimate change\\u201d with \\u201cglobal change\\u201d in a project he submitted for the oil industry. He said that regardless of how it is labeled, interest in climate research would likely endure given the importance of extreme weather forecasting to a broad array of industries, like insurance and energy. However, he was concerned the longer-term work crucial to understanding the scope of global warming could lose critical support. Climate scientist Ben Sanderson, also at NCAR, told Reuters he is applying to renew funding for assessing uncertainty in climate change. \\u201cNow the proposal would have to be defensible without referring to climate change explicitly, so to talk about weather risks in general,\\u201d he said. Tracey Holloway, an air quality scientist at the University of Wisconsin, said she believed simple word changes sometimes could help scientists avoid trouble. Using the term \\u201cweather\\u201d instead of \\u201cclimate change,\\u201d for example, could work for studies that deal with a short-term time scale, she said. But Eric Holthaus, a meteorologist who writes for online magazine Slate, has taken efforts to protect scientists and their work a step further.  He spearhead an effort, with the support of the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Toronto, to let scientists move their data onto publicly available non-government servers. The project, called \\u201cDataRefuge,\\u201d is intended to eliminate the chances of political interference with the data, he said. The signals from the Trump transition team on climate change have also put members of Obama\\u2019s outgoing administration on edge. Current Interior Secretary Sally Jewell told scientists at a conference in San Francisco this week they must confront climate change deniers and speak up if Trump tries to sideline them. White House spokesman Josh Earnest later said in a press briefing he believed the concerns of the scientific community about Trump were \\u201clegitimate.\\u201d  \\u201cIf the incoming administration determines that they want to base their policy on something other than science, it looks like they\\u2019re going to get at least four years to try that out and we\\u2019ll have an opportunity to see how it works,\\u201d he said. Other scientists were dealing with the stress of a new administration using humor. University of South Florida glaciologist Jason Gulley said his team had a list of joke projects for science under Trump. \\u201cHow could we weaponize glaciers?\\u201d he asked, and what is the best real estate currently hidden under Greenland ice sheets.     \",\n          \"This morning, a man drove his car into a crowd near the UK s parliament building and began attacking bystanders with a knife. Across the ocean, America s conservative handled the scary situation with characteristic boorishness. At the forefront of this despicable behavior was President Trump s own son. British police hadn t even confirmed the number of dead before Donald Trump Jr used the attack as a pretext to promote Islamophobia on Twitter.While emergencies workers worked on the injured and police began piecing together what happened, Don Jr. decided his contribution would be to spread a vicious and pathetic lie about London s mayor. Why would he focus on this man while the city was still in shock? Because Mayor Sadiq Khan is Muslim.In a tweet, Don Jr. implied Khan was somehow sympathetic to terrorists, inaccurately quoting him as having said  Terror attacks are part of living in big city [sic].  Don commented: You have got to be kidding me?! You have to be kidding me?!: Terror attacks are part of living in big city, says London Mayor Sadiq Khan https://t.co/uSm2pwRTjO  Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) March 22, 2017Like clockwork, other conservative Trump-clingers began running with the quote as well.Will London's Muslim mayor, @SadiqKhan, once again say that Muslim terror attacks are just \\\"part and parcel\\\" of living in a major city?  Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) March 22, 2017Can't wait for London s Muslim Mayor to lecture us about how terror attacks are  part and parcel  of urban life  again.  Faith J. Goldy  ?? (@FaithGoldy) March 22, 2017The problem: The quote and the link used in Don Jr. s tweet are ludicrously wrong. The real quote paints Khan as a man not sympathetic to terrorism but vigilant about stopping terrorism. Here s the full quote given in 2016 to the Evening Standard: What I do know is that part and parcel of living in a great, global city is that you ve got to be prepared for these sort of things. You ve got to be vigilant. You ve got to support the police who do an incredibly hard job. You ve got to support the security services and I think speculating when you don t know the facts is unwise. In other words, Khan is doing all the things every mayor in every major city in the world is doing: Working to stop terrorism while knowing that a big city s size and landmarks make tempting targets. Nowhere does he accept that terrorism is  part and parcel  of urban life. Fighting it is.Don Jr has yet to express any condolences to the families of the victims. He s so far tweeted exclusively about Muslims (including this lie about London s mayor). The lack of basic decency seems to run in the family. Don Jr. s dad once commented on the mass shooting in Orlando by infamously saying  appreciate the congrats. It s like every tragedy is seen not as a horrifying moment of pain and suffering for the victims but something to be exploited to further an agenda. Don Jr desperately wants to smear Muslims and if it means lying about the mayor of the city that was just attacked, then that s what he ll do.Featured image via John Sommers II/Getty Images\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"class\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":21}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.reset_index(inplace = True)\n","df.drop([\"index\"], axis = 1, inplace = True)\n","df.columns"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"I4T20lIQzz8r","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1748167510844,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":17,"user":{"displayName":"Akshitha Chunchu","userId":"06024285106304277630"}},"outputId":"0ed63429-df10-41fa-dccb-9f035290231d"},"execution_count":23,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["Index(['text', 'class'], dtype='object')"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":23}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"9EWrhHCn51xw","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1748167523617,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":940,"user":{"displayName":"Akshitha Chunchu","userId":"06024285106304277630"}},"outputId":"a111d18f-8e8a-4887-ff5f-f9199b6970fa"},"execution_count":24,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                text  class\n","0  This is what happens when people are more conc...      0\n","1  WASHINGTON (Reuters) -

Brawling, fraud, theft, booze and paranoia are quickly turning the situation in Oregon into the fastest failure of a publicly funded reality TV show ever.Blaine Cooper, whose real name is Stanley Blaine Hicks, was accused by another militia member of assaulting him with a sucker punch. The victim of the assault, Jeff Kagan, quickly called upon the government he hates when he dialed 911 after the assault. No reason was given for the assault, other than the fact Kagan walked from his camp across the street, towards the main militia gathering area. When he approached the area, Cooper attacked both Kagan and one other individual. Cooper also attacked one of a 3-member group of people who came to help remove a suicidal veteran who suffered from PTSD. Allegations were made that Cooper planned on using the veteran literally as a target to provoke a violent confrontation with federal authorities, by exploiting his PTSD and suicidal tendencies. While Cooper appears to still be there, he has prevented others from joining to grow their numbers. Count him as about 3 to 4 lost members.Self-titled  Captain  Joe O Shaughnessy stole crowdfunded money from the group s  war chest  to fuel a drinking binge at a local motel. This caused him to be branded a  deserter and a coward  by fellow militia members, such as John Ritzheimer. After all the booze money was gone, the  captain  left the standoff and claimed all statements made about him by the militia members are a smear campaign.Brian  Booda  Cavalier, who goes by the name Fluffy Unicorn (yes he really does) has also been forced out of the militia as well. This happened after he was caught lying about being a former marine when the US Marines confirmed with the press that he has never served a day in his life. Cavalier was the personal bodyguard of Ammon Bundy for a time.The infamous  blue tarp man  LaVoy Finicum, is also leaving the gathering, despite his allegations that the FBI will arrest him if he does. I need to get home. I got cows that are scattered and lost,  Finicum was quoted as saying. Clearly he should have brought his cows with him so he could take care of them.Initial reports that indicated the militia were numbering around 150 individuals appear to have been exaggerated as well. The group was actually 15 people and now it is down to 12 without a federal officer firing a single shot due to bad behavior and directionally challenged cows.Perhaps the first Bundy standoff was more  successful  and avoided mockery because it was relatively new. Who really knows? With luck, these people will make being in a militia as uncool as your dad wearing socks with sandals while chaperoning the school dance.Featured image via WMUR\",\n          \"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Climate scientists worried that President-elect Donald Trump will slash their budgets and sideline their research are entering survival mode, trimming the words \\u201cclimate change\\u201d from study proposals, emphasizing business applications of their work, and safeguarding data that shows global warming is real. The early reactions, gathered by Reuters in more than a dozen interviews, may foretell a broader shift in the U.S. climate science community, which had enjoyed solid political and financial support under President Barack Obama but could be isolated under a new administration skeptical of climate change and committed to expanding oil drilling and coal mining. \\u201cI think it is maybe really necessary to refocus what you are doing and how you are labeling it,\\u201d said Andreas Prein, a scientist at the federally funded National Center for Atmospheric Research, who previously had changed the term \\u201cclimate change\\u201d in a project for the oil industry and expects such linguistic twists to proliferate.  Trump has questioned whether climate change exists and has raised the possibility of withdrawing U.S. support for a global accord to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, which an overwhelming majority of scientists believe is driving sea level rise, droughts and more frequent violent storms.  Trump is also preparing to nominate cabinet members with close oil industry ties, including Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of state and former Texas Governor Rick Perry as energy secretary. A member of the transition team further raised concerns among scientists this month by sending a questionnaire to the Department of Energy seeking the names of researchers there who worked on climate change issues, a move Trump\\u2019s team later disavowed. Federal funding for climate change research, technology and international assistance hit $11.6 billion in 2014, from $2.4 billion in 1993, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office. While Trump has not explicitly said he would cut such funding, one of his advisers told The Guardian newspaper last month that climate research at NASA would be eliminated.  A Trump transition team official did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Prein at National Center for Atmospheric Research said he had replaced the politically charged term \\u201cclimate change\\u201d with \\u201cglobal change\\u201d in a project he submitted for the oil industry. He said that regardless of how it is labeled, interest in climate research would likely endure given the importance of extreme weather forecasting to a broad array of industries, like insurance and energy. However, he was concerned the longer-term work crucial to understanding the scope of global warming could lose critical support. Climate scientist Ben Sanderson, also at NCAR, told Reuters he is applying to renew funding for assessing uncertainty in climate change. \\u201cNow the proposal would have to be defensible without referring to climate change explicitly, so to talk about weather risks in general,\\u201d he said. Tracey Holloway, an air quality scientist at the University of Wisconsin, said she believed simple word changes sometimes could help scientists avoid trouble. Using the term \\u201cweather\\u201d instead of \\u201cclimate change,\\u201d for example, could work for studies that deal with a short-term time scale, she said. But Eric Holthaus, a meteorologist who writes for online magazine Slate, has taken efforts to protect scientists and their work a step further.  He spearhead an effort, with the support of the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Toronto, to let scientists move their data onto publicly available non-government servers. The project, called \\u201cDataRefuge,\\u201d is intended to eliminate the chances of political interference with the data, he said. The signals from the Trump transition team on climate change have also put members of Obama\\u2019s outgoing administration on edge. Current Interior Secretary Sally Jewell told scientists at a conference in San Francisco this week they must confront climate change deniers and speak up if Trump tries to sideline them. White House spokesman Josh Earnest later said in a press briefing he believed the concerns of the scientific community about Trump were \\u201clegitimate.\\u201d  \\u201cIf the incoming administration determines that they want to base their policy on something other than science, it looks like they\\u2019re going to get at least four years to try that out and we\\u2019ll have an opportunity to see how it works,\\u201d he said. Other scientists were dealing with the stress of a new administration using humor. University of South Florida glaciologist Jason Gulley said his team had a list of joke projects for science under Trump. \\u201cHow could we weaponize glaciers?\\u201d he asked, and what is the best real estate currently hidden under Greenland ice sheets.     \",\n          \"This morning, a man drove his car into a crowd near the UK s parliament building and began attacking bystanders with a knife. Across the ocean, America s conservative handled the scary situation with characteristic boorishness. At the forefront of this despicable behavior was President Trump s own son. British police hadn t even confirmed the number of dead before Donald Trump Jr used the attack as a pretext to promote Islamophobia on Twitter.While emergencies workers worked on the injured and police began piecing together what happened, Don Jr. decided his contribution would be to spread a vicious and pathetic lie about London s mayor. Why would he focus on this man while the city was still in shock? Because Mayor Sadiq Khan is Muslim.In a tweet, Don Jr. implied Khan was somehow sympathetic to terrorists, inaccurately quoting him as having said  Terror attacks are part of living in big city [sic].  Don commented: You have got to be kidding me?! You have to be kidding me?!: Terror attacks are part of living in big city, says London Mayor Sadiq Khan https://t.co/uSm2pwRTjO  Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) March 22, 2017Like clockwork, other conservative Trump-clingers began running with the quote as well.Will London's Muslim mayor, @SadiqKhan, once again say that Muslim terror attacks are just \\\"part and parcel\\\" of living in a major city?  Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) March 22, 2017Can't wait for London s Muslim Mayor to lecture us about how terror attacks are  part and parcel  of urban life  again.  Faith J. Goldy  ?? (@FaithGoldy) March 22, 2017The problem: The quote and the link used in Don Jr. s tweet are ludicrously wrong. The real quote paints Khan as a man not sympathetic to terrorism but vigilant about stopping terrorism. Here s the full quote given in 2016 to the Evening Standard: What I do know is that part and parcel of living in a great, global city is that you ve got to be prepared for these sort of things. You ve got to be vigilant. You ve got to support the police who do an incredibly hard job. You ve got to support the security services and I think speculating when you don t know the facts is unwise. In other words, Khan is doing all the things every mayor in every major city in the world is doing: Working to stop terrorism while knowing that a big city s size and landmarks make tempting targets. Nowhere does he accept that terrorism is  part and parcel  of urban life. Fighting it is.Don Jr has yet to express any condolences to the families of the victims. He s so far tweeted exclusively about Muslims (including this lie about London s mayor). The lack of basic decency seems to run in the family. Don Jr. s dad once commented on the mass shooting in Orlando by infamously saying  appreciate the congrats. It s like every tragedy is seen not as a horrifying moment of pain and suffering for the victims but something to be exploited to further an agenda. Don Jr desperately wants to smear Muslims and if it means lying about the mayor of the city that was just attacked, then that s what he ll do.Featured image via John Sommers II/Getty Images\"\n

allies on Tuesday welcomed President Donald Trump s decision to commit more forces to Afghanistan, as part of a new U.S. strategy he said would require more troops and funding from America s partners. Having run for the White House last year on a pledge to withdraw swiftly from Afghanistan, Trump reversed course on Monday and promised a stepped-up military campaign against  Taliban insurgents, saying:  Our troops will fight to win .  U.S. officials said he had signed off on plans to send about 4,000 more U.S. troops to add to the roughly 8,400 now deployed in Afghanistan. But his speech did not define benchmarks for successfully ending the war that began with the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, and which he acknowledged had required an   extraordinary sacrifice of blood and treasure .  We will ask our NATO allies and global partners to support our new strategy, with additional troops and funding increases in line with our own. We are confident they will,  Trump said. That comment signaled he would further increase pressure on U.S. partners who have already been jolted by his repeated demands to step up their contributions to NATO and his description of the alliance as  obsolete  - even though, since taking office, he has said this is no longer the case. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement:  NATO remains fully committed to Afghanistan and I am looking forward to discussing the way ahead with (Defense) Secretary (James) Mattis and our Allies and international partners.  NATO has 12,000 troops in Afghanistan, and 15 countries have pledged more, Stoltenberg said. Britain, a leading NATO member, called the U.S. commitment  very welcome .  In my call with Secretary Mattis yesterday we agreed that despite the challenges, we have to stay the course in Afghanistan to help build up its fragile democracy and reduce the terrorist threat to the West,  Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said. Germany, which has borne the brunt of Trump s criticism over  the scale of its defense spending, also welcomed the new U.S. plan.  Our continued commitment is necessary on the path to stabilizing the country,  a government spokeswoman said. In June, European allies had already pledged more troops but had not given details on numbers, waiting for the Trump administration to outline its strategy for the region.Nearly 16 years after the U.S.-led invasion - a response to the Sept. 11 attacks which were planned by al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden from Afghanistan - the country is still struggling with weak central government and a Taliban insurgency. Trump said he shared the frustration of the American people who were  weary of war without victory , but a hasty withdrawal would create a vacuum for groups like Islamic State and al Qaeda to fill.\n","\n","\n","LR Prediction: Not A Fake News \n","DT Prediction: Not A Fake News \n","RFC Prediction: Not A Fake News\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["news = str(input())\n","manual_testing(news)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"5ryTVGw_J9Pe","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1748171755218,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":10134,"user":{"displayName":"Akshitha Chunchu","userId":"06024285106304277630"}},"outputId":"577803b4-57dc-44c2-a738-3fade6abbe87"},"execution_count":47,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Vic Bishop Waking TimesOur reality is carefully constructed by powerful corporate, political and special interest sources in order to covertly sway public opinion. Blatant lies are often televised regarding terrorism, food, war, health, etc. They are fashioned to sway public opinion and condition viewers to accept what have become destructive societal norms.The practice of manipulating and controlling public opinion with distorted media messages has become so common that there is a whole industry formed around this. The entire role of this brainwashing industry is to figure out how to spin information to journalists, similar to the lobbying of government. It is never really clear just how much truth the journalists receive because the news industry has become complacent. The messages that it presents are shaped by corporate powers who often spend millions on advertising with the six conglomerates that own 90% of the media:General Electric (GE), News-Corp, Disney, Viacom, Time Warner, and CBS. Yet, these corporations function under many different brands, such as FOX, ABC, CNN, Comcast, Wall Street Journal, etc, giving people the perception of choice   As Tavistock s researchers showed, it was important that the victims of mass brainwashing not be aware that their environment was being controlled; there should thus be a vast number of sources for information, whose messages could be varied slightly, so as to mask the sense of external control. ~ Specialist of mass brainwashing, L. WolfeNew Brainwashing Tactic Called AstroturfWith alternative media on the rise, the propaganda machine continues to expand. Below is a video of Sharyl Attkisson, investigative reporter with CBS, during which she explains how  astroturf,  or fake grassroots movements, are used to spin information not only to influence journalists but to sway public opinion. Astroturf is a perversion of grassroots. Astroturf is when political, corporate or other special interests disguise themselves and publish blogs, start facebook and twitter accounts, publish ads, letters to the editor, or simply post comments online, to try to fool you into thinking an independent or grassroots movement is speaking. ~ Sharyl Attkisson, Investigative ReporterHow do you separate fact from fiction? Sharyl Attkisson finishes her talk with some insights on how to identify signsof propaganda and astroturfing  These methods are used to give people the impression that there is widespread support for an agenda, when, in reality, one may not exist. Astroturf tactics are also used to discredit or criticize those that disagree with certain agendas, using stereotypical names such as conspiracy theorist or quack. When in fact when someone dares to reveal the truth or questions the  official  story, it should spark a deeper curiosity and encourage further scrutiny of the information.This article (Journalist Reveals Tactics Brainwashing Industry Uses to Manipulate the Public) was originally created and published by Waking Times and is published here under a Creative Commons license with attribution to Vic Bishop and WakingTimes.com.
